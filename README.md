# Lua Chess Game

A simple chess game built in Lua, using the Love2D game engine. This project is a learning exercise to explore Lua programming, the LÃ–VE framework, game development concepts, and chess mechanics.

## Features

- **Chessboard and Pieces**: Implements standard chess rules and movement.
- **Basic Gameplay**: Play as white or black, with local two-player support.
- **Learning-Focused**: Designed as a project to practice Lua programming and game development skills.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Love2D**: Download and install the [Love2D game engine](https://love2d.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone or download the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lua-chess-game.git
   ```
2. Open the folder in your terminal or file explorer.
3. Run the game with Love2D:
   ```bash
   love .
   ```

## Controls

- **Left-click**: Select and move pieces.
- **Right-click**: Cancel selection.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Complete rendering to work for resizing, multiple screen modes, and refreshing.
- [ ] Change from direct adding pieces to fixed positions over to using profiles so chess notation can be used to place pieces in different start places for different scenarios/modes.
- [X] Fix piece asset rendering.
- [X] Implement basic chess rules (complete).
- [ ] Add check and checkmate detection.
- [X] Highlight valid moves for selected pieces.
- [ ] Add AI opponent (future enhancement).
- [ ] Improve graphics and animations.
- [ ] Save and load game state.

## Technologies Used

- **Lua**: Lightweight and embeddable programming language.
- **Love2D**: Framework for 2D game development.
